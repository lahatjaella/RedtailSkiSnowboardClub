# Redtail Ski and Snowboard Club Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Redtail Ski and Snowboard Club website. This project involved making specific enhancements to ensure the website looks great on computer screens, fixing issues with hover effects on mobile devices, and making sure the site is accessible for users with motion sickness.

## Overview

This project addresses the following requirements provided by the client, Sara, to improve the user experience and visual appeal of the Redtail Ski and Snowboard Club website on larger screens.

## Features and Improvements

### Text Adjustments on Big Screens
- **Left-Aligned Paragraph Text:** All paragraph text on larger screens is now aligned to the left, providing a cleaner and more organized look.
- **Increased Paragraph Text Size:** The size of the paragraph text has been increased for better readability, with careful consideration to line spacing to avoid scrunched lines.
- **Larger Page Title Text:** The page title text size has been increased to make it more prominent and engaging.

### Skier Picture Adjustments on Big Screens
- **Picture Positioning:** The picture of the skier has been moved to the left side of the page, with text wrapping around it to create a balanced layout.
- **Adjusted Picture Size:** The skier picture now takes up a little less than half of the page width, ensuring it looks even with the text.
- **Added Space Around Picture:** Extra space has been added around the picture to prevent the text from getting too close, enhancing visual comfort.

### Hover Effect Fixes on Mobile Devices
- **Removed Sticky Hover Effects:** The hover effects on the navbar links and the rotating snowflake logo have been fixed. These effects no longer get stuck when tapped on mobile devices, providing a smoother user experience.

### Hidden Section Restoration
- **Restored Mountain Picture Section:** The hidden section with the mountain picture has been restored on larger screens, ensuring it looks great without affecting the mobile view.

### Motion Sickness Accommodations
- **Reduced Motion Effect:** The cool scrolling effect of the mountain picture has been modified to respect users' reduced motion settings. Users prone to motion sickness will not see this effect, providing them with a comfortable browsing experience.
- **Disabled Hover Effect for Reduced Motion Users:** The hover effect on the snowflake logo is also disabled for users with reduced motion settings, ensuring an inclusive and accessible website.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Responsive Design Techniques:** Ensuring the website looks great on all devices, including mobile phones and large screens.
